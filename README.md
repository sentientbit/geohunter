# geohunter

Location based scavenger hunt game with a RPG questline which takes place in real life.

- Access the game anywhere that offers an internet connection, requiring no download or special plugins to play.
- Infinite random weapons and armor items, based on a few easy to modify base values.
- Dozens of already created item rarities, classes and weapon modifiers.
- Choose quest outcomes between the seemingly insignificant, and heavy weighted decisions.
- Pick between three factions: the mysterious Syndicate, the elusive Shadow Vanguard or the brave Paladins that start you off but donâ€™t limit you in what you want to do.
- Join or create a guild with your friends to take down larger quests.
